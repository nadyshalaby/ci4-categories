3. create test database (e.g. `ci_categories`).

4. Copy `env` to `.env` and edit your `.env` file with your datebase credentials and your application URL `app.baseURL`.

5. execute command `php spark migrate && php spark db:seed CategorySeeder`

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
